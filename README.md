# Subliminal Vim 0.1a1

[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/LuisAlejandro/subliminal-view](https://badges.gitter.im/LuisAlejandro/subliminal-view.svg)](https://gitter.im/LuisAlejandro/subliminal-view?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

> A drop-in replacement for Sublime Text based on vim and urxvt

**Attention: this in an alpha release. Don't use it on production environments as
you will probably experience bugs.**

*Subliminal Vim* is a group of Vim plugins and configurations designed to resemble
the appeareance and functionality of Sublime Text. Its main purpose is to make
users from Sublime to be more comfortable using Vim and perhaps encourage them
to switch IDE environments in the future.

*Subliminal Vim* needs a graphical interface to work because we need urxvt for
proper key shorcuts, but in the future this might change. This means it won't
work on server environments, sorry. *Subliminal Vim* ships as a separate binary
and does not integrate with Vim (yet). See [Usage](#usage) for details.

Also, for now we are only supporting Debian-based systems on the installation
script, but you might want to try installing on a different OS and tell us how
you you did it, or submit a
[greatly appreciated PR](https://github.com/LuisAlejandro/subliminal-vim/pulls).

## Installation

1. First we're going to install the dependencies needed for the installation
script to run properly. Open a root terminal and type the following command:

    ```
    apt-get install make sudo git
    ```

2. Next, we have to clone Sublime Vim repository from github with the following
command. Remember to previously put the prompt on an appropiate folder and be
logged in with your user.

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/LuisAlejandro/subliminal-vim

    ```

3. Finally, start the installation process with the following commands. This
will take a few minutes to complete depending on your internet connection speed.

    ```
    make
    make install
    ```
